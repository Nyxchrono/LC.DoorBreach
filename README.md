# DoorBreach

## Overview

DoorBreach is a mod for Lethal Company that allows players to hit a locked door many times with a shovel to open it.
This mod aims to solve those pesky situations in which you enter encounter a locked door but can not find a darn key anywhere.
By default, a door will take 10 to 20 hits before unlocking and opening (configurable).

Does not add any new items/models/sounds/etc. Simply changes how doors behave when collided by a shovel swing.
